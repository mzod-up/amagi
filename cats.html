        <h3>2. They're independent.</h3>
        <p class="article__p">
          They like to go out on their own adventures sometimes, so you don't
          really have to worry if your cat goes missing for a little while.
          Besides,

            >they're natural hunters with great survival skills</a
          >.

        <h3>3. They're thoughtful.</h3>
        <p class="article__p">
          Sometimes they leave you presents (and who doesn't like presents!)
          including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mice</li>
          <li>Lizards</li>
          <li>Birds</li>

        <h3>4. They all have different personalities.</h3>
        <p class="article__p">
          Just like people do. Not all of them are mean or feisty like in the
          movies.<br />Here are some stats for cats I've gotten to know
          personally:

          <tr>
            <td>Pretty Aloof</td>
            <td>2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Literally Hates People</td>
            <td>
              1,
              <span>yes Matrix this is about you</span>

        <h3>5. They're silly.</h3>
        <p class="article__p">
          They're super curious and sometimes it makes them do silly things.<br />There
          are lots of videos of cats being silly. YouTube <b>loves</b> them.

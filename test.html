    <h1>There are a million reasons why cats are awesome...</h1>
    <h2>but here are 5:</h2>

    <h3>1. They're cool little guys.</h3>
    <p>
      They just look cool. Check out
      <a href="https://twitter.com/unicouniuni3">Uni</a>. That perfect mouth
      shape. <em>*Chef's kiss*</em> <br /><br />

    <h3>2. They're independent.</h3>
    <p>
      You don't have to worry if your cat goes missing for a little while. They
      like to go out on their own adventures sometimes!
      <br />
      <a href="https://www.catster.com/guides/are-cats-independent/"
        >They're natural hunters with great survival skills</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>3. They're very thoughtful.</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes they leave you presents (and who doesn't like presents),
      including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mice</li>
      <li>Lizards</li>
      <li>Birds</li>
      <li>Your neighbor's favorite socks</li>
      <li>Other dead stuff...</li>
    </ul>

    Mine gave me a squid once. Don't know how he got a hold of that.

    <h3>4. They all have different personalities.</h3>
    <p>
      Just like people do! Not all of them are mean or feisty like in the
      movies.<br />Here are some stats for the ones I've gotten to know
      personally:
    </p>

    <table style="border-collapse: collapse">
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid grey"><b>Personality</b></td>
        <td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid grey"></b>Count</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid grey">Super Friendly</td>
        <td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid grey">4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid grey">Pretty Aloof</td>
        <td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid grey">2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid grey">
          Literally Hates People
        </td>
        <td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid grey">
          1
          <span style="text-decoration: line-through"
            >(yes Matrix this is about you)</span
          >
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>5. They're silly.</h3>
    <p>
      They're super curious and sometimes it makes them do silly things.<br />There
      are lots of videos of cats being silly. YouTube
      <b>loves</b> them.
    </p>
    <br /><br /><br />

    Show cats a little more love. Boop that snoot!
